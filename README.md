## Highlighted Projects
**PolicyConnect UK - Interactive Poverty Analysis Tool**
Leveraging the power of Python and Dash, I developed an interactive web application that can assist UK policymakers in making informed decisions. It explores the impact of various socio-economic indicators on UK poverty levels, using machine learning models to simulate the effects of policy changes on poverty reduction. This tool offers dynamic, real-time visualizations and policy recommendations based on user manipulation of indicators.
**SpeedWise AccidentReductor**
I created the SpeedWise AccidentReductor. It is a dynamic tool designed to inform road safety decisions in line with the Welsh Government's objectives. It combines predictive analytics with a simulator to evaluate speed policy implications and offers geospatial visualisations for localised accident predictions. Enhanced by features like region-specific dropdowns and custom feedback, this tool provides granular insights to guide evidence-based policy adjustments.

**Multi-Factor Analysis of Nigeria's Socio-Economic Conditions**
I pioneered an insightful data visualization web app to shed light on Nigeria's socio-economic landscape. Utilizing Dash and Plotly, this interactive tool enables researchers, policymakers, and the public to delve into crucial socio-economic indicators. The app features compelling visualizations, including scatter plots and correlation heatmaps, which provide valuable insights into Nigeria's development patterns.
